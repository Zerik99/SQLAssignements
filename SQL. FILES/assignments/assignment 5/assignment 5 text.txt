/*4 The Marketing Department of JustLee Books is preparing for its annual sales promotion. Each customer who places an order during the promotion will 
receive a free gift with each book purchased. Each gift will be based on the book’s retail price. JustLee Books also participates in co-op advertising
programs with certain publishers. If the publisher’s name is included in advertisements, JustLee Books is reimbursed a certain percentage of the 
advertisement costs. To determine the projected costs of this year’s sales promotion, the Marketing Department needs the publisher’s name, profit amount, 
and free gift description for each book in the JustLee Books inventory.  (Hint: use a non-equality join to look up them ‘gift’ from the promotion table using 
the retail column in the books table.)*/

of the second query from the results of the first query.)*/
